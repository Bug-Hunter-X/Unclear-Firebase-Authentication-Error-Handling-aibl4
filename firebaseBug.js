The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's credentials are invalid or if there's a network issue during authentication.  For instance, using `signInWithEmailAndPassword` with incorrect email or password may lead to an error that isn't very descriptive, making debugging difficult.  The error messages aren't always user-friendly and require careful examination to pinpoint the specific cause.
